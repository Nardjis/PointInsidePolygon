# PointInsidePolygon
To know if a point(x,y) is inside a polygon or not
using the method of the infinite horizontal half line from the concerned point
Summary:
We draw an infinite horizontal half line starting from the point and we see how much it intersects the polygon
if the number of intersections is odd then the point is inside the polygon
